<h2>
WHY RAMUNCHO
</h2>
<p> 
In 2006 I was working as an intern in a two-Michelin star restaurant in Paris. It was my first job. I was 17. I could barely speak French and was (like any respectable intern) under-qualified for the job.
<br><br>
The sum of the above earned me the nickname “Ramuncho”, after a character from French TV Le Bigdil. Ramuncho - the TV character - was an “odd gentleman, pretty much a fool and a stutterer, yet quite gifted for puns”.
<br><br>
Calling me Ramuncho, was meant an insult.
